# Yip Engine/API/Library

**IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

The core engine behind Yip, exposed as a node module consumable by... *well, anything*. Yet to be released/published.

## Overview

 * Core (data / core API): `src/core`
 * Conglomeration (...): `[todo]`

## Engine notes

### Todo: Consider / Think About / Develop:

 * Discovery API / related to conglomeration [?]
  * Diffusion ticker / checker ( governs popularity )
  * Specific location monitor ( for discovery )
 * Core
  * User-made judgements ( voting, rating, etc. )
  * Moderation hooks ( moderation queueing, user/mod profiling for suitability )
  * User credibility governance ( hooks for credibility consideration )
 * General [TBD]
  * Meaningful metric API consideration ( exposed metrics, bounds, stats )
